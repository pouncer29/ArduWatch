Hey there! SO this is my way of writing very long commit messages without
writing very long commit messages! I thought it would be nice to have a 
running log of whats up for each branch merge that goes a bit deeper than
a commit.

What I Did:
 - made a makefile first try.
 - renamed playGround.cc to testNodes.cc
 - almost broke git again but didn't
 - bitched out of using linker commands.

What we should do next:
 - Consider trying the linker thing again (more for practice than function)
 - Consider your default colours
 - consider making a watch controller .cc file.
 - consider utilizing that makefile.

I'm hesitant to go to far into the watch controller bcause I know I'll
likely have to create a whole new .cc &.h file to deal with the radio
clock api or the wifiapi or the ape api whichever it has.

Hope this doesn't break git!
