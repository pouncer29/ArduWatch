I am headed to USST today to learn how to use arduinos and what not.
Turns out adafruit has a bunch of tools for their neopixels so I can
control the whole ring of 12 with one pin. I will need one of those to
test that so for now I am just going to work on buttons, circuts, and how
to test an arduino and its code rather than just the later.
